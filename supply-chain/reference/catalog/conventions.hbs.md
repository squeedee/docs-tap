# Conventions Component

## Description

This topic describes the Conventions component for Tanzu Supply Chain.

The Conventions component is a way to invoke the convention controller in a Tanzu Supply Chain.

The conventions controller is a sub component of Cartographer Conventions.

Cartographer Conventions is composed of the convention controller and convention server.
For more information, see [Overview of Cartographer Conventions](../../../cartographer-conventions/about.hbs.md).

> **Note** conventions controller is bundled with the Cartographer Conventions package for
Tanzu Application Platform v1.8, however it will be in a dedicated
package for Tanzu Application Platform v1.9.

## API

Component Input: `image`

Workload Input: `spec.env` can contain an optional array of objects. Each object is a pair of
keys: `name` and `value`.
The Conventions component translates these values into environment variables in
the output object.

```console
spec:
  source: TEST
  env:
  - name: TEST_KEY_1
    value: TEST_VALUE_1
  - name: TEST_KEY_2
    value: TEST_VALUE_2
```

Component Output: `conventions`

OCI Output: An artifact in the OCI store. This artifact contains one file, `app-config.yaml`, with
a pod template spec.

## Dependencies

- Supply Chain
- Supply Chain Catalog
- Managed Resource Controller
- Tekton
- Conventions Controller

## Input Description

The Conventions component takes an `image` input from an earlier component in the supply chain.
The component expects the image to be provided as a reference to a runnable artifact in an OCI
registry (i.e.: some image intended to be run
as a container in a pod), e.g.: `my.registry/my.project/my.image@sha256:digest`.
The Conventions component passes this
image reference to the conventions controller to analyze.

## Output Description

The Conventions component produces a `conventions` output stored in an OCI registry referenced by
the shared `oci-store`
`Secret`.  A reference to this image will be passed to subsequent components in the supply chain.

The output image contains a single file, `app-config.yaml`.  This file contains a Kubernetes Pod
Template Spec under a `template` field in YAML.  For example:

```yaml
template:
  spec:
    containers:
    - env:
      - name: TEST_KEY_1
        value: TEST_VALUE_1
      - name: TEST_KEY_2
        value: TEST_VALUE_2
      image: my-image@sha256:digest
      name: workload
      resources: {}
      securityContext:
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
        capabilities:
          drop:
          - ALL
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 1001
        seccompProfile:
          type: RuntimeDefault
    serviceAccountName: default
```

The `image` from the component input is echoed in the `template.spec.containers[0].image` field.

The conventions controller passes the image reference to any conventions servers installed on the
cluster. Each server has the opportunity to further decorate the Pod template spec.

__Optional:__ In addition to the image field, the Conventions component can also add the settings in the Workload's
`spec.env` into the Pod template's `env` field.  The `spec.env` field, if present, is expected to contain an array of
`name`/`value` pairs.  You can use this feature to set environment variables in any pods produced by the supply chain.

Example workload with two environment variables:

```yaml
apiVersion: widget.com/v1alpha1
kind: conventiontest
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: conventions-component
spec:
  source: TEST
  env:
  - name: TEST_KEY_1
    value: TEST_VALUE_1
  - name: TEST_KEY_2
    value: TEST_VALUE_2
```

The Conventions component also provides a default security context and service account.
